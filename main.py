st.markdown('''
An Income-tax calculator is an online tool that helps to evaluate taxes based on a personâ€™s income once the Union Budget for the year is announced. Individuals falling under the taxable income bracket are liable to pay a specific portion of their net annual income as tax. Income tax can be paid either as tax deducted at source while disbursement of monthly salary, or through the income tax returns portal managed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). The provision for online payment of taxes is to ensure individuals pay their stipulated dues on any earnings generated from other sources.The IT calculator given on this page is aligned with the updates announced in the Union Budget for FY 2023-24 and AY 2024-25.''')
